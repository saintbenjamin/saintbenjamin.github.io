EuljiroBible is a Bible search and rapid slide output application developed
for worship services at The Eulji-ro Presbyterian Church (TongHap).

It supports both GUI and CLI workflows and is designed to provide fast,
reliable Bible verse and keyword search in live worship environments.
The system is optimized for Korean usage while maintaining a modular
architecture that supports multiple languages and a wide range of
Bible translations.

This documentation provides developer-oriented references, including
module and package documentation generated from source code docstrings,
as well as internal design notes describing the responsibilities and
interactions of each component.

It is intended for developers and maintainers who want to understand,
extend, or integrate EuljiroBible into their own workflows.
